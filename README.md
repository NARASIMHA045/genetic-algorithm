# Genetic Algorithm – String Matching

This project demonstrates a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** implemented in **Python** to evolve a population of strings until it matches a given **target string**.

It is a beginner-friendly example showing the core concepts of evolutionary algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

- Random population initialization  
- Fitness-based sorting of individuals  
- **Selection** of best parents  
- **Crossover** to create new children  
- **Mutation** to maintain diversity  
- Stops automatically when the **target string is found**

## 🧠 Genetic Algorithm Concepts Used

- **Population** – set of candidate solutions  
- **Fitness Function** – measures how close a string is to the target  
- **Selection** – choosing best individuals for reproduction  
- **Crossover** – combining two parents to form a child  
- **Mutation** – random character change to explore new solutions  
- **Elitism** – keeping the best individuals for the next generation
